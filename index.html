      <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br />
          were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br />
          honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>

      <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a<br /> 
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br />
      the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br />
      weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve<br />
      successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br /> themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
        learning from<br /> their experiences was easy.</h1>

        <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br /> program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br /> myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br /> personal attention you need from 
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

      <h1 class="secondH">Such a life-changing<br /> experience. Highly<br /> recommended!</h1>

      <p class="secondP">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br /> never written a line of code. I needed<br /> some structure from 
      professionals<br /> who can help me learn programming<br /> step by step. I was encouraged to<br /> enroll by a former 
      student of theirs<br /> who can only say wonderful things<br/> about the program. The entire<br /> curriculum and staff 
      did not<br /> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br /> and I never had to wait long for<br /> assistance. The agile team 
      project, in<br /> particular, was outstanding. It took<br /> my learning to the next level in a way<br /> that no tutorial 
      could ever have. In<br /> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br /> interviews as an example of my<br /> developent 
      experience. It certainly<br /> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br /> developer after receiving multiple<br /> offers. 
      100% recommend! ”</p>
